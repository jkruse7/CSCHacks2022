# Mmates
## Project Description
One of the hardest parts of the college process is searching for a roommate. Most people use either Facebook or Instagram to find their roommates, and it is by no means efficient in helping you find one. So we created an app called Mmates(short for roommates) which helps to streamline the searching process. 

Basically, when the app is run, you will be sent to a home screen where you can log in or register & create your profile. All the data when you register your account gets stored in a Firebase databse. And then once the account is registered and the data is stored in Firebase, you are sent to a page which lists all your matches. You are also able to send messages on the app and swipe on matches, similar to tinder. Additionally, you can view your own profile. 

At the moment, we are working to not only make this app available for others but also finish the syncing of the Firebase to the app, that way the top matches you see, the matches you swipe on, and your own profile will be the real accounts that exist in Firebase(right now they are hard coded for the purpose of showing how they would look). We are also working to add more features like an edit button, logout button, and other matching information.

We used Swift (XCode) to actually create the app and Firebase to store the user data, both of which we are all learning for the first time! This project was a lot of fun and we learned a lot! And we are so excited to continue working and improving it to hopefully someday maybe even have it be available on the app store!!
