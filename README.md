# Mmates
## Project Description
One of the hardest parts of the college process is searching for a roommate. Most people use either Facebook or Instagram to find their roommates, and it is by no means efficient in helping you find one. So we created an app called Mmates(short for roommates) which helps to streamline the searching process. We used Swift (XCode) to actually create the app and Firebase to store the user data. 

Basically, when you run the app, you will be sent to a home screen where you can log in or register & create your profile. And then once you do so, you are sent to a page which lists all your matches. You are also able to send messages on the app and swipe on matches, similar to tinder. You can also view your own profile. 

At the moment, we are working to finish the syncing of the firebase to the app, that way the matches will be real accounts. We are also working to add more features like an edit button, logout button, and other matching information.

Overall though, this project was a lot of fun! And we are so excited to continue working and improving it to hopefully someday maybe be available on the app store!!
